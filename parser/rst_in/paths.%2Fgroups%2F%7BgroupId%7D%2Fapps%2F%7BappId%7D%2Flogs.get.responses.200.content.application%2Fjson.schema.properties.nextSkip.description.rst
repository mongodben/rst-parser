The offset into the next page of log entries in ISO 8601 format. MongoDB Realm paginates the result sets of queries that match more than 100 log entries and includes this field in paginated responses where the first entry on the next page has the same timestamp as the last entry on this page. To get the next page of up to 100 entries, pass this value, if it is present, as the ``skip`` parameter in a subsequent request.
